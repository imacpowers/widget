### News Widget for Planner App
The News Widget is an appropriate addition to a Planner App for the following reasons:

**1. Information and Awareness**
A Planner App aims to provide users with a comprehensive tool for organizing and managing their daily tasks, schedules, and important events. Including a News Widget enhances the app's functionality by providing users with relevant news and updates. It helps users stay informed and aware of current events, trends, and news stories that may impact their day-to-day activities and decision-making.

**2. Contextual Relevance**
By integrating a News Widget, the Planner App can offer contextually relevant news based on the user's preferences and interests. The widget can allow users to customize their news feed by choosing specific topics or keywords they want to follow. This personalization ensures that the news articles displayed align with the user's interests and needs, providing them with tailored and meaningful information.

**3. Productivity Enhancement**
While the Reminder Widget, Calendar Widget, Timer Widget, and Time and Date Widget primarily focus on managing time and tasks, the News Widget complements these features by keeping users informed without having to switch to a separate news app or website. It saves users time and effort by conveniently providing news updates within the Planner App interface, creating a seamless user experience.

**4. Broadens User Engagement**
Introducing a News Widget adds another layer of engagement and interactivity to the Planner App. Users can browse news articles, read headlines, and access detailed information without leaving the app. By incorporating diverse content, the Planner App becomes a centralized hub that caters to users' various needs, enhancing their overall engagement and satisfaction.

**5. Synergy with Existing Widgets**
The News Widget synergizes well with the existing widgets in the Planner App. For example:

Reminder Widget: The News Widget can be used to display news articles relevant to upcoming events or tasks, providing users with additional context and information.
Calendar Widget: The News Widget can be used to show news related to holidays, local events, or significant dates, enriching the user's calendar experience.
Timer Widget: While waiting for a timer to complete, users can catch up on the latest news articles conveniently through the News Widget.
Time and Date Widget: The News Widget complements the time and date information by presenting real-time news updates, allowing users to stay up to date while managing their schedules.
Therefore, incorporating a News Widget into a Planner App enhances the user experience, increases productivity, broadens engagement, and complements the existing set of widgets. It provides users with valuable news information within a unified app environment, ensuring they stay informed without disrupting their planning and organizing activities.

# News Widget - Usage Guide

The News Widget consists of two parts: the frontend component written in React (MyCustomWidget.js) and the backend server (server.js). This guide will explain how to use and integrate the News Widget into your application.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
2. A valid API key for the News API service. You can obtain one by signing up on the [News API website](https://newsapi.org/).
3. A Pusher account and app credentials. You can create an app on the [Pusher website](https://pusher.com/) and obtain the required credentials.

## Frontend Setup (MyCustomWidget.js)

1. Copy the contents of `MyCustomWidget.js` into your React project's file or component.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your project's root directory:
   ```
   npm install pusher-js pushid
   ```

3. Replace the placeholder Pusher app credentials in the `setupPusher()` function with your own app credentials.

4. Customize the styling and layout of the News Widget according to your app's design.

5. The News Widget component expects the following CSS classes to be defined for proper styling:
   - `news-item`: Represents a single news item container.
   - `news-item-link`: Represents the link to the full news article.
   - `news-item-image`: Represents the image associated with the news article.
   - `NewsWidget-title`: Represents the title of the News Widget.
   - `search-form`: Represents the form for submitting search queries.
   - `NewsWidget-newsItems`: Represents the container for displaying the list of news items.

6. Include the `MyCustomWidget` component in your app's desired location and ensure that it is rendered within a parent component.

## Backend Setup (server.js)

1. Copy the contents of `server.js` into a new file named `server.js` in your project's backend directory.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your project's backend directory:
   ```
   npm install express cors pusher newsapi
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in your backend directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```
   PUSHER_APP_ID=YOUR_PUSHER_APP_ID
   PUSHER_APP_KEY=YOUR_PUSHER_APP_KEY
   PUSHER_APP_SECRET=YOUR_PUSHER_APP_SECRET
   PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=YOUR_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER
   NEWS_API_KEY=YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY
   ```

4. Replace the placeholders `YOUR_PUSHER_APP_ID`, `YOUR_PUSHER_APP_KEY`, `YOUR_PUSHER_APP_SECRET`, `YOUR_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER`, and `YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY` with your actual Pusher and News API credentials.

5. Run the backend server by executing the following command in your project's backend directory:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

   This will start the server and listen for requests on the specified port (default: 5000). Make sure the server is running and accessible before proceeding.

## Integrating the News Widget

To integrate the News Widget into your application:

1. Make sure both the frontend and backend servers are running.

2. In your frontend component or file, import the `MyCustomWidget` component.

3. Include the `MyCustomWidget` component in your app's desired location and ensure that it is rendered within a parent component.

4. Customize the placement and appearance of the News Widget based on your app's design and layout.

5. Test the News Widget by interacting with the search feature, viewing and clicking on news articles, and verifying that new articles are fetched and displayed automatically.

## Additional Customization

The News Widget can be further customized to suit your specific requirements:

- Modify the number of displayed news items by adjusting the `slice()` function in the `fetchNewsData()` function.
- Customize the interval for fetching new articles by modifying the `setInterval()` function in the `updateFeed()` function in `server.js`.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the News Widget into your application. Users will be able to view and interact with the latest news articles, enhancing their experience and keeping them informed within your app's environment. Feel free to customize and extend the widget to align with your app's unique features and design.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
